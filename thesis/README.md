This example demonstrates how to typeset a large book-like document.
Using a real document forces us to consider many issues that may occur for
real documents but not for example documents. 

Rather than try to reproduce the original document or reproduce TeX/LaTeX's
output I am taking the opportunity to modify the typesetting.  For example
the original uses one and a half line spacing.  This uses single spacing and
this should hopefully save paper (if anyone prints this out).  I have also
taken the opportunity to fix typesetting (but not other) errors in the
original: for example page numbers were incorrectly printed on blank pages
in the original.
